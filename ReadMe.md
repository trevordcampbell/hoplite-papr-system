# HOPLITE: The World's Best Daily-Wear PAPR System

## Overview

It shocks me that, in 2024, the world still lacks excellent first-line-of-defense PPE technologies against infectious respiratory pathogens. The problem is not that we're unable to design solutions which are safe enough — It's that nobody put in the extra effort required to make them human-friendly and comfortable for long-duration use.

So what are the existing options for respiratory protection?

#### "Standard" Masks

This includes things like the classic blue "medical" mask you might see your dentist wearing, as well as the N95 masks we all came to know and love during the COVID pandemic. N95 masks are *ok* (certainly a lot better than rawdogging the air), but they still lack the high protection factor that immunocompromised and high-risk individuals *really* need to be protected from dangerous pathogens and materials they encounter on a day-to-day basis.

Masks are also generally **terrible** for human interactions — aside from the social stigma they now carry in some situations, they muffle the wearer's speech and obscure visibility to the wearer's mouth and face. This can make interactions with mask wearers particularly tough, especially for those who are hearing impaired (who often rely on the added visual cue of lip reading to support auditory processing of speech).

If you want a greater protection factor than a standard elastomeric-fit N95 mask, you could upgrade to a reusable half-face respirator outfitted with P100 filters (which filter out 99.97% of airborne particles). I have one of these, and it works really well... but there are still problems: 

- The wearer's mouth and speech are both greatly obscured.

- They're not very comfortable for long-duration use, and often collect lots of moisture inside the mask.

- To breathe with one of these masks requires the wearer to inhale with greater pressure in order to draw air through the filters — This can be quite taxing over a long period of wear, and can also be difficult for people with reduced lung function.

All of these factors combined makes traditional masks highly inconducive to human interactions, penalizing both the wearer and those around around them.

So what is the alternative to a standard N95 Mask or a reusable mask kitted with P100 filters?

#### Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) Systems

Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) use an electrically-powered fan or blower in combination with filters to supply clean airflow directly into the wearer's mask. You've probably seen one before — they evoke the idea of HAZMAT suit.

The protection factor of PAPR systems is very high, especially ones utilizing tight-fitting masks, since they supply highly filtered air while also maintaining a positive-pressure environment within the mask (which make it even more difficult for harmful pathogens and materials in the environment to enter the mask). PAPR systems often utilize face shield designs that offer full-face coverage, which also shields the eyes and typically allows for greater visibility of the wearer's face compared to standard N95 masks.

For reference, a tight-fitting full-face coverage PAPR system generally provide an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of ~1,000, which is one hundred times greater than the APF of an N95 mask (~10).

The COVID pandemic saw a large increase in the use of PAPR systems by clinicians in Emergency Care and Intensive Care Units. However clinicians found these PAPR systems to be clunky with insufficient battery life to handle an entire shift effectively, and they were too loud (Producing a noise level of ~74dB within the mask, roughly the noise level of a vacuum cleaner) which affected their ability to communicate with teammates and patients.

So PAPR Systems come with their fair share of problems too:

- PAPR systems are somewhat loud, typically producing a noise around 70-80 dB during operation, which is disruptive to conversation and those around the wearer

- The wearer's speech is still obscured by the obstruction of the mask, making it more difficult to communicate with those around them

- They may not have sufficient battery life to support long-duration usage (which may lead to insufficient protection and workflow interruptions)

The bottom line is that we **can** do better than this... which is why I've decided to start making something better:  HOPLITE, A robust PAPR system which has been designed from the ground up to be highly effective with a high protection factor, while also being extremely ergonomic, comfortable, and friendly to long-duration use by both the wearer and everyone around them.

Something wearers will be confident and proud to use as a capable and comfortable first-line-of-defense tool against infectious respiratory pathogens.

## Who Is HOPLITE For?

The HOPLITE Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) system is designed for everyone! With a focus on ergonomics designed for comfortable daily and long-duration wear, HOPLITE can be used by anyone looking to protect themselves from harmful respiratory environments.

It works well for anyone who is concerned with dust and poor air quality environments, or shielding their respiratory system from biological vectors such as viruses and bacterial pathogens.

Because of it's robust and human-interaction friendly design, HOPLITE is also well-suited for use by healthcare workers in clinical environments such as Emergency care and intensive care units seeking to protect themselves from pathogens present in the workplace. Since HOPLITE is quiet and utilizes an onboard communications package, individuals may find it easier to communicate with team members and patients compared to other PAPR systems they have tried before.

These same factors make it well-suited for a wide range of applications. Some examples of people HOPLITE is designed for:

- Chronic Respiratory Patients with Cystic Fibrosis, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, Bronchiectasis, COPD, etc

- Healthcare workers in Emergency care, Intensive Care Units,

- Laboratory Workers

- Construction Workers

- Agricultural and Food Production Workers

- Immunocompromised individuals

- People who live in areas with hazardous levels of air pollution

## HOPLITE Design Specifications:

Below is a set of design specifications outlined for the HOPLITE Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) System.

#### Powered Air Filtration System:

- Motor must be as quiet as mechanically possible. Fan + Motor noise at two feet ideally as close to 30dB as possible. Target range is 30 – 45dB maximum

- Must be easily disinfectable (AS many parts as possible)

- Easily Serviceable and cleanable (parts should be easily replaceable without special tools)

- Hot-Swappable Filters for easy long-term use

- Hot-Swappable Battery Packs for easy long-term use

- NIOSH minimum air flowrate of 115 LPM – 170 LPM (Settings where you can alter the speed, i.e. "Hurricane, High, Medium, Low, and Breath Following / adaptive, or maybe custom LPM values if needed)

- Water resistance of IP67 or greater – must be suitable for wide range of environments and cleaning approaches
  
  - If we need serious protection, maybe seek IP69K

- If we can avoid it, no custom filters or batteries, use filters and batteries available off the shelf if feasible

- Generally try to use as much off-the-shelf hardware as possible

<u>Optional Filtration System Features to Consider:</u>

- Ability to heat / cool supplied air
  
  - 3M makes some clever powerless baffles for this…

- Could have an auto-coiling hose/cable for extra length / "give" when needed (assuming filter is separate from mask and hosing is used)

- Real-time air quality measurement of inlet air + supplied air / mask environment

- Ability to manage humidity level of supplied air

#### Mask:

- Ensure tight seal for all design styles to ensure high protection factor

- Shape and general design must be ergonomic and comfortable for long-term, repeated use

- Must be easily wearable for people with glasses (although this might not be possible for the "Full Face" style design if we end up leaving the ears exposed, as this might jeopardize the integrity of the tight seal)

- impact + scratch-resistant face shield material

- Face shield should be easily replaceable

- Use natively antimicrobial materials everywhere possible, anti-microbial coatings on non native materials if absolutely necessary.

- Mask Styles:
  
  - Minimal Profile:
    Cover nose and mouth, but leave eyes unobstructed
  
  - Full-Face Profile:
    Cover Full face, but leave ears unblocked. Face and mouth should be visible and unobscured
  
  - "Helmet" Profile:
    Cover entire head and neck, full head containment. Face and mouth should be visible and unobscured

    <u>Optional Mask Features to Consider:</u>

- Filterable exhalation venting (instead of straight venting of exhalation, which will make it applicable for source control)

- Ideally should be compatible with oxygen supplementation tubing / systems, so can still be actively worn at the same time for people who require O2 supplementation.

- In-facing and out-facing lights (for illuminating surroundings and illuminating face, if needed)
  
  - Alternative would be to provide a headlamp mount, which would simplify the native mask design

- Auto-darkening face shield for sun protection / welding protection

###### Onboard Communications Package:

- Microphone integrated into mask modularly, but easily removable + replaceable
  
  - Will be important in case the component needs to be replaced, or mask parts need to be separated and cleaned

- Out-facing speaker integrated into mask modularly, but easily removable + replaceable
  
  - Will be important in case the component needs to be replaced, or mask parts need to be separated and cleaned…
  - Ideally made of sanitizable materials too
  - Waterproofing IP 66–69 or something – must be suitable for decontamination

- Power connector that is supplied from a cable in line with air supply tubing, but must have a through-mask connector which does not compromise the seal integrity
  
  - Could potentially substitute an in-mask battery to power peripherals and handle comms via bluetooth / BLE / other... but makes more complicated maybe and more prone to error.

- Waterproofing IP 66 or something – must be suitable for decontamination

<u>Optional Communications Package Features to Consider:</u>

- Can work with Bluetooth / wireless / radio for non line-of-sight comms (maybe pair with AirPods / other bluetooth earbuds)
- Wireless / Radio communication with the integrated comms package
  - Could be useful for worksites and labs
  - Probably need to put receiver / transmitter far away from the motor, unless we can shield the motor really well to prevent EMI
- Separate battery for the mask / comms package than the Filtration system? (assuming they are separate systems)

#### Other Possible HOPLITE System Features:

- Get the system FAA approved for use on airplanes (may require filtered exhalation venting)

- Ability to broadcast PAPR data to the web via phone connection (might be useful for live monitoring of operation, especially for worksites and lab environments)

### Design challenges:

- Getting accurate audio from within the mask while the outboard speaker is projecting in very close proximity might cause feedback / distortion
  - Need to find a small microphone with very strong directional rejection (supercardioid probably)
  - Need to find a speaker with very forward-projecting bias, even at high volumes
  - Clever placement and design of the mask and isolation will be needed too
- Need to do a really good job of shielding the motor + fan to prevent EMI leakage to any peripheral or surrounding systems

- TODO: There's a lot more 😅

## Supporting Research:

- Breath-following PAPR:
  
  - [Research on the air supply adjustment technology of breath-following powered air-purifying respirators | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-39411-z)
    
    > The BF-PAPR can reduce the air flow by 6.5%-8.6% compared to the PAPR while maintaining respiratory protection performance, which is beneficial for extending the service life of the filter and reducing the usage cost.
    > 
    > At the same time, the BF-PAPR can reduce energy consumption by approximately 20%, which will help to extend its continuous working time. However, a BF-PAPR is more expensive than a traditional PAPR with a constant air supply flow.
    > 
    > The breath-following adjustment system, consisting mainly of a single-chip microcontroller, a variable-frequency centrifugal fan, and a modular wind speed transmitter, costs about $200. The high price of the BF-PAPR may hinder its widespread use.

    > According to one manufacturer, active filtration with a PAPR produces ambient noise of approximately 74 dB within the hood—slightly louder than a vacuum cleaner.
    > 
    > - At baseline, all subjects had a score ≥92% (mean, 95%)
    > - During active PAPR use, when sound was presented at 55 dB (approximates normal speaking volume), the mean score was 2%
    > - No subject could correctly identify >3 words in a 25-word list (12%) when the words were presented at 55 dB
    > - Presentation at 85–90 dB was needed to obtain scores similar to baseline and support successful communication
